Summary Overview
================
_<our game>_ is a game where the player has the ability to exert a force from any point on the screen causing objects to be pushed away from its centre. The aim is then to navigate a ball through the map to reach an end goal _without_ the ability to directly interact with the ball. This encourages the player to come up with his or her own way of getting the ball from point a to point b. The game will present many challenges for the player to overcome, some of which being black holes that will pull the ball towards them while other objects such as magnets may force the ball away.

Target Audience
----------------
_<our game>_ is aimed at the casual user, someone with limited play time and who may only play for short periods of time. At the same time, we want the game to be engaging and difficult enough that more hardcore puzzle gamers will sit down and not be able to leave this game.
