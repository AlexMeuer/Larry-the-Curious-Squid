# Larry the Curious Squid

TODO: Write a project description
_Larry the Curious Squid_ (_LtCS_, working title) is a game where the player has the ability to exert a force from any point on the screen causing _all_ objects to be pushed away from its centre. The aim is then to navigate a ball through the map to reach an end goal _without_ the ability to directly interact with the ball. We want to encourage the player to come up with his or her own way of getting the ball from point A to point B. The game will present many challenges for the player to overcome, some of which being black holes that will pull the ball towards them while other objects such as magnets may force the ball away.

## Installation

The game is not in installable, maybe not even playable, form right now.
When we have an installer working or a end-user package, this section will be updated.

Summary Overview
================
_our game_ is a game where the player has the ability to exert a force from any point on the screen causing objects to be pushed away from its centre. The aim is then to navigate a ball through the map to reach an end goal _without_ the ability to directly interact with the ball. This encourages the player to come up with his or her own way of getting the ball from point a to point b. The game will present many challenges for the player to overcome, some of which being black holes that will pull the ball towards them while other objects such as magnets may force the ball away.

Target Audience
----------------
_our game_ is aimed at the casual user, someone with limited play time and who may only play for short periods of time. At the same time, we want the game to be engaging and difficult enough that more hardcore puzzle gamers will sit down and not be able to leave this game.
